# HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS

ideas -
- watch a couple Jim Simons vids on HMMS
- large vs small avg trade size
- look into Jim's regimes and make those the states that are predicted
- maybe put liquidations in there ... these could be good to help identify point of capitulation upward or down..
- open interest, funding rates
- THe masks could be used to backtest strategies. For example you might want to see how a particular trading strategy performs 
only during periods identified as "state 1".
- You could look at state-specific metrics like "What's the average daily return when we're in state 2?"
- In live trading, identifying the current state could trigger different trading rules or risk management strategies. 

HMMS can predict hidden states and market regimes...

Here's a concise bullet point list to help you understand and remember how Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) work for identifying market regimes in trading algorithms:

HMMs assume markets have hidden states (regimes) that we can't directly observe
These hidden states influence observable market features (price, volume, etc.)

Key components of HMMs:
Hidden states: Different market regimes (e.g., bull, bear, sideways)
Observable features: Market data we can measure
Transition probabilities: Likelihood of moving between states
Emission probabilities: Likelihood of observing certain data in each state

HMM process for trading:
Define possible market regimes (hidden states)
Select relevant observable features
Train the model on historical data
Use the model to infer current market regime
Make trading decisions based on the inferred regime

Benefits of HMMs:
Can capture complex market dynamics
Adapt to changing market conditions
Provide probabilistic framework for decision-making

Applications in trading:
Asset allocation
Risk management
Entry/exit timing
Portfolio rebalancing

Considerations:
Regime definitions are subjective
Requires careful feature selection
Performance depends on quality of training data
Need to regularly retrain the model
Remember, HMMs help you "see" the invisible market regimes by analyzing patterns in observable data, allowing you to adjust your trading strategy accordingly.

- HMM based on sentiment, but where do we get sentiment
maybe the fear and greed index
he shows that a HMM is 10x better than random but the RNN is 2x better than HMM... not necessarily holding true.
