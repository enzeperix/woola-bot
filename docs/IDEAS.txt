- Build OHLCV data based on natural patterns and golden ratios like Fibbonacci sequences. 
  Example: Redefine OHLCV timeframes  from 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 60m to 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m, 8m, 13m, 21m, 34m, 55m etc. (Fib numbers)

  Suggestions to Improve Efficiency:
Parallelize Data Preprocessing:

Use libraries like Dask or Vaex for faster dataframe manipulation.
For lagged feature creation and other heavy operations, leverage multi-threaded or multi-core processing.
For large datasets, lagged operations can be slow. If performance becomes an issue, consider using libraries like Numba or Dask for faster computation.
Optimize Feature Engineering:

Use NumPy instead of pandas where possible as it's faster and more efficient.
Reduce the number of lagged features or scale down the data for testing to speed up preprocessing.
Save Preprocessed Data:

If the preprocessing is taking too long, save the preprocessed dataset to disk after the first run. On subsequent runs, you can directly load this data, skipping the preprocessing step.
Streamline TensorFlow Input Pipeline:

Use TensorFlow's tf.data API to create an efficient input pipeline for the model training. This helps in reducing bottlenecks between data preparation and GPU utilization.
Measure Bottlenecks:

Use Python profiling tools (e.g., cProfile, line_profiler) to identify the exact operations causing delays and focus optimization efforts there.
Minimize Memory Footprint:

Ensure the dataset is loaded in chunks or batches if it's too large to fit into memory.
Enable Mixed Precision Training:

If your GPU supports mixed precision (likely with your NVIDIA RTX A2000), you can enable TensorFlow's mixed precision policy to speed up training and reduce memory usage:
python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.mixed_precision import experimental as mixed_precision
policy = mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')
mixed_precision.set_policy(policy)

Use tools like RandomForest or SHAP to analyze feature contributions.
